# Nautilus AI Agent
---------------
- This agent is used to connect with AI Prompt servers and executes the actions from the Prompt results.

## Supported Tools
- These are the tools available with the agent

- [ ] curl
- [ ] python3

## Development

- Agent is based on linux 6.11.11 kernel

## Serve webpages

1. Run `python3 -m http.server 3000` and go to `http://localhost:3000/vm/index.html`

## Cold boot and saving a new snapshot

1. Go the `http://localhost:3000/vm/index.html?boot=true`

2. Once the boot is completed, clear the cache and start psql (the runtime assumes psql is running when it loads a snapshot):
 `echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches && echo 3 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk && reset && psql -U postgres`

3. Save the state to a file clicking the `Save state to file` button

4. Put the state file into the `state` folder and compress it using [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd):

```bash
zstd --ultra -22 state/v86state.bin && rm state/v86state.bin
```
